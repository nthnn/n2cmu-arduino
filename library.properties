sentence=Official Arduino library for N2CMU (Neural Network Coprocessing Microcontroller Unit) available on Arduino Package Manager and PlatformIO.
paragraph=N2CMU is a project aimed at implementing a neural network coprocessing microcontroller unit (MCU) for STM32F103C8T6 Bluepill development board using the TinyGo (Go programming language for embedded systems). This MCU enables offloading feedforward neural network computations to a dedicated hardware unit, allowing for efficient and low-power feedforward neural network training and inference on small hardware embedded systems.
